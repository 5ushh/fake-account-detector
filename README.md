Fake Account Detector on Social Media Using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect fake social media accounts using machine learning techniques. It uses user data such as followers, friends, posts, and account age to train a model that predicts whether an account is fake or real.

Project Structure

- `data/` - Contains the dataset (`fake_accounts.csv`)
- `scripts/` - Contains the training (`train.py`) and prediction (`predict.py`) scripts
- `models/` - Saves the trained machine learning model (`fake_acc_model.pkl`)

Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`
